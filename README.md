# StumpTrump
Can you stump the trump?

requires pygame, openCV

Uses openCV and motion detection to allow you to fight against Donald Trump's clone army as they try to "Make America great again"

To punch, aim at the trumps on screen and punch towards them (don't actually punch your screen)

(This is all for the sake of the hacks, and I have no personal agenda against Donald Trump. That being said, #feelTheBern2k16)
